Hello all! In this quest, we needed to find the minimum amount of hits it takes to make all the nails in a piece of wood. We are given a list of nail heights as numbers. In part 1 and 2, we just need to find the smallest nail height and match all the nails to it, meaning we add the differences between them to find how many hits it takes. For part 3, we can also increase a nails height, so we can brute force all possible combinations of possible nail heights and find which one takes the smallest amounts of hits.
