Hello all! Welcome to a new year of EverybodyCodes. I won't be able to compete when the puzzle opens everyday (it seems to open around 4p for me every weekday), but I will still try to complete it as fast as possible. Today's puzzle is about finding our name and our parent's names for the "duckborns". All the parts consisted of some array math, so let's get started. Part 1 asked us to move the pointer left or right depending on the direction, and then making sure that if it falls of a side, it stays at the end. This is pretty much a clamp function, not to hard to implement. Part 2 asked us to wrap around, making the list circular. Funnily enough, I actually made this solution for part 1 first as I thought that is what it was asking. Oh well, I got to reuse it anyways. Part 3 doesn't have a pointer perse, but rather a need to swap the first and the needed elements. This used similar calculations for part 2, but I implemented a swap with the JS syntax sugar. This first day seems to be a pretty good start so far, and I am happy to keep going!
